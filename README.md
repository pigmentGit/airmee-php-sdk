# Airmee PHP SDK

[Everything in this file is subject to change as we evolve the SDK]

API documentation available at: <http://integration.docs.airmee.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/>

Basic flow of the integration process: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=13vg0jsBPaGoygjvpUl38iTmu5s5P8Gf2hKBDgg7sEII>

### Classes

- Main classes proposed for the Airmee SDK
- Decide what is the most logical way to implement constructors for the objects (would a builder pattern be sufficient?)

---

##### Address

(
street_and_number string,
city string,
zip_code string,
country string
)

- Role: Standard representation of an address
- Constraints: all fields not null / empty

---

##### Item

(
parcel_id string,
length double,
width double,
height double,
weight double,
quantity integer,
price integer,
name string
)

- Role: Standard representation of an item selected by a user while shopping online
- Constraints:
  - length, width, heigh, weight, quantity not null and positive
  - name not null / empty

---

##### Delivery_Interval

(
pickup_time_earliest bigint,
pickup_time_latest bigint,
dropoff_time_earliest bigint,
dropoff_time_latest bigint,
pickup_schedule_formatted string,
dropoff_schedule_formatted string
)

- Role: Standard representation of the delivery intervals used by Airmee
- Constraints:

  - pickup_time_earliest, pickup_time_latest, dropoff_time_earliest, dropoff_time_latest not null and positive
  - pickup_schedule_formatted, dropoff_schedule_formatted not null / empty
  - pickup_time_earliest < pickup_time_latest
  - dropoff_time_earliest < dropoff_time_latest

- NOTE: The parameters should be immutable since they are served by the server. What's the best constructor pattern for this?

---

##### Delivery_Request

(
dropoff_address Address,
delivered_items Item[],

ecomm_id,
receiver_name,
receiver_phone_number,
receiver_phone_number_country_code,
receiver_email,

chosen_delivery_intervals DeliveryInterval,

dropoff_message_to_courier [optional],
dropoff_lat [optional],
dropoff_lon [optional]
)

- Role: Standard representation of the delivery request used by Airmee
- Constraints:
  - dropoff_address is not null and valid
  - delivered_items is not null, the array is not empty, and all the items inside are valid
  - ecomm_id, receiver_name not null / empty
  - receiver_phone_number(\_country_code) valid -> maybe validate with <https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php>
  - receiver_email is valid / not nul -> use regex validation
  - chosen_delivery_interval is valid / not null

### Functions

- Decide how to easily present these functions to the SDK consumers
- Should we have one class that provides all the functions?

##### get_Delivery_Intervals_For_Zip_Code(zip_code string)

##### create_Delivery_Request(lots of params...)

### Tests, Documentation and Versioning

- What do we use for tests?
- What documentation should we have? There are 2 types of documentations: facing the SDK consumers and facing the SDK devs
- Semantic Versioning: <http://semver.org/>
- What to use for dependency management?
